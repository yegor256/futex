# Futex (file mutex) is a fine-grained mutex that uses a file, not an entire
# thread, like <tt>Mutex</tt> does. Use it like this:
#
#  require 'futex'
#  Futex.new('/tmp/my-file.txt').open |f|
#    IO.write(f, 'Hello, world!')
#  end
#
# The file <tt>/tmp/my-file.txt.lock<tt> will be created and
# used as an entrance lock. If the file is already locked by another thread
# or another process, exception <tt>Futex::CantLock</tt> will be raised.
#
# If you are not planning to write to the file, to speed things up, you may
# want to get a non-exclusive access to it, by providing <tt>false</tt> to
# the method <tt>open()</tt>:
#
#  require 'futex'
#  Futex.new('/tmp/my-file.txt').open(false) |f|
#    IO.read(f)
#  end

  # Open the file. By default the file will be locked for exclusive access,
  # which means that absolutely no other process will be able to do the same.
  # This type of access (exclusive) is supposed to be used when you are
  # making changes to the file. However, very often you may need just to
  # read it and it's OK to let many processes do the reading at the same time,
  # provided none of them do the writing. In that case you should call this
  # method <tt>open()</tt> with <tt>false</tt> first argument, which will mean
  # "shared" access. Many threads and processes may have shared access to the
  # same lock file, but they all will stop and wait if one of them will require
  # an "exclusive" access. This mechanism is inherited from POSIX, read about
  # it <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/flock.2.html">here</a>.
